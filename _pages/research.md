## Test 1
I am presently a PhD student in the Center for Ocean Observing Leadership at Rutgers University ([RUCOOL](https://rucool.marine.rutgers.edu/)). My research at Rutgers is currently focused on developing a system to process data from an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted on a Teledyne-Webb Research Slocum glider in real-time. This system will enable the investigation of both process-based and data assimilation improvements for hurricane forecast models.

## Test 2
Prior to coming to Rutgers, I worked as a Customer Support Applications Engineer on Slocum gliders for [Teledyne Webb Research](http://www.teledynemarine.com/webb-research/). I was primarily involved with testing and developing new glider software features while also supporting customers via remote field campaigns and technical trainings.

## Test 3
I conducted Master's work at the University of Delaware with Matt Oliver in the [ORB Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/ceoe-moliver/). While at UD, my [research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JC015646) investigated sea surface kinetic energy as a proxy for phytoplankton light limitation in the Southern Ocean through the use of [SOCCOM floats](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) as well as satellite and modeled parameters.
