## Breaking Slocum Gliders
Prior to coming to Rutgers, I worked as a Customer Support Applications Engineer on Slocum gliders for [Teledyne Webb Research](http://www.teledynemarine.com/webb-research/). I was primarily involved with testing and developing new glider software features while also supporting customers via remote field campaigns and technical trainings. During my time with TWR, I worked on lab and field testing of the under-ice and station keeping behaviors as well as development and testing of the STM-32 processor. Naturally I became very good at breaking gliders, of course with the goal of improving and hardening the system! I also was one of the lead pilots during the last two legs of Silbo's Trans-Atlantic Challenger Mission, where this glider went from the Canary Islands to St. Thomas (417 days, 6256 km) and then from St. Thomas to Cape Cod (348 days, 6236 km).

## Kinetic Energy and Phytoplankton
I conducted Master's work at the University of Delaware with Matt Oliver in the [ORB Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/ceoe-moliver/). While at UD, my [research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JC015646) investigated sea surface kinetic energy as a proxy for phytoplankton light limitation in the Southern Ocean through the use of [SOCCOM floats](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) as well as satellite and modeled parameters. Our JGR: Oceans' publication showed that low surface kinetic energy behaves like a necessary but not sufficient condition for high chlorophyll concentrations. In high kinetic energy conditions, high chlorophyll concentrations arer are. Conversely, under low kinetic energy conditions, both high and low chlorophyll concentrations were observed. We showed that higher kinetic energy conditions are related to deeper mixed layers, which is likely a proxy for local light conditions.
