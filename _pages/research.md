## Breaking Slocum Gliders
Prior to coming to Rutgers, I worked as a Customer Support Applications Engineer on Slocum gliders for [Teledyne Webb Research](http://www.teledynemarine.com/webb-research/). I was primarily involved with testing and developing new glider software features while also supporting customers via remote field campaigns and technical trainings.

## Kinetic Energy and Phytoplankton
I conducted Master's work at the University of Delaware with Matt Oliver in the [ORB Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/ceoe-moliver/). While at UD, my [research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JC015646) investigated sea surface kinetic energy as a proxy for phytoplankton light limitation in the Southern Ocean through the use of [SOCCOM floats](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) as well as satellite and modeled parameters.
