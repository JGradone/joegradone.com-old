## Onboard Processing for Glider ADCPs
There is a growing number of increasingly complex instruments have been integrated into autonomous underwater vehicles over the past two decades. While  these newly glider integrated sensors provide unprecedented insight into ocean processes, the large data volumes collected by these instruments cannot be efficiently telemetered to shore. There is a need for a sensor agnostic real-time processing software and hardware architecture for autonomous underwater vehicles. Working with Travis Miles, Eli Hunter, Julia Engdahl, and the software team at Teledyne Webb Research, we have begun integrating a Raspberry-Pi into a G3S Slocum Glider to perform real-time processing of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data. While this is ongoing work, initial findings from this work can be found in our Marine Technology Society Conference [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9705895). The Python code used for ADCP processing can be found [here](https://github.com/JGradone/Glider_ADCP_Real_Time_Processing).

## Breaking Slocum Gliders
Prior to coming to Rutgers, I worked as a Customer Support Applications Engineer on Slocum gliders for [Teledyne Webb Research](http://www.teledynemarine.com/webb-research/). I was primarily involved with testing and developing new glider software features while also supporting customers via remote field campaigns and technical trainings. During my time with TWR, I worked on lab and field testing of the under-ice and station keeping behaviors as well as development and testing of the STM-32 processor. Naturally I became very good at breaking gliders, of course with the goal of improving and hardening the system! I also was one of the lead pilots during the last two legs of Silbo's Trans-Atlantic Challenger Mission, where this glider went from the Canary Islands to St. Thomas (417 days, 6256 km) and then from St. Thomas to Cape Cod (348 days, 6236 km).

## Kinetic Energy and Phytoplankton
I conducted Master's work at the University of Delaware with Matt Oliver in the [ORB Lab](https://sites.udel.edu/ceoe-moliver/). While at UD, my [research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JC015646) investigated sea surface kinetic energy as a proxy for phytoplankton light limitation in the Southern Ocean through the use of [SOCCOM floats](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) as well as satellite and modeled parameters. Our JGR: Oceans' publication showed that low surface kinetic energy behaves like a necessary but not sufficient condition for high chlorophyll concentrations. In high kinetic energy conditions, high chlorophyll concentrations arer are. Conversely, under low kinetic energy conditions, both high and low chlorophyll concentrations were observed. We showed that higher kinetic energy conditions are related to deeper mixed layers, which is likely a proxy for local light conditions.
